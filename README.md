<h1>Book Recommendation System</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
This project implements a Book Recommendation System using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to recommend books based on user preferences and book characteristics. The system leverages two primary datasets: users and ratings, along with books data, to deliver personalized recommendations.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
Python for data manipulation and model development<br>
Pandas for data handling and processing<br>
Scikit-learn for implementing recommendation algorithms<br>
Collaborative Filtering to recommend books based on user interactions<br>
Content-Based Filtering to recommend books based on book features<br>

<h2>Key Features</h2>
Collaborative Filtering: Recommends books based on similarities between user preferences.<br>
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends books based on the attributes (genre, author, etc.) of the books the user has rated highly.<br>
Personalized Recommendations: Offers tailored book suggestions to users based on their individual preferences and ratings history.<br>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
Clone or download the repository.<br>
Install required libraries:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas scikit-learn<br>
Load the datasets (users, ratings, and books).<br>
Run the book_recommendation.py script to generate recommendations for a specific user.<br>

<h2>Usage</h2>
Input user data and ratings to get book recommendations.<br>
Modify the filtering technique to experiment with collaborative or content-based approaches.<br>

<h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
Implement hybrid recommendation models combining both techniques for better accuracy.<br>
Incorporate user feedback for continuous model improvement.<br>
This project demonstrates skills in machine learning, data analysis, and building personalized recommendation systems.
