<h1>Book Recommendation System</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
This project implements a Book Recommendation System using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to recommend books based on user preferences and book characteristics. The system leverages two primary datasets: users and ratings, along with books data, to deliver personalized recommendations.

Technologies Used
Python for data manipulation and model development
Pandas for data handling and processing
Scikit-learn for implementing recommendation algorithms
Collaborative Filtering to recommend books based on user interactions
Content-Based Filtering to recommend books based on book features
Key Features
Collaborative Filtering: Recommends books based on similarities between user preferences.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends books based on the attributes (genre, author, etc.) of the books the user has rated highly.
Personalized Recommendations: Offers tailored book suggestions to users based on their individual preferences and ratings history.
Getting Started
Clone or download the repository.
Install required libraries:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas scikit-learn
Load the datasets (users, ratings, and books).
Run the book_recommendation.py script to generate recommendations for a specific user.
Usage
Input user data and ratings to get book recommendations.
Modify the filtering technique to experiment with collaborative or content-based approaches.
Future Enhancements
Implement hybrid recommendation models combining both techniques for better accuracy.
Incorporate user feedback for continuous model improvement.
This project demonstrates skills in machine learning, data analysis, and building personalized recommendation systems.
